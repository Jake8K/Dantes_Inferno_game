# Dantes_Inferno_game

a short text based game, modern version of Dante's Inferno.

To compile download the repo and from the directory, enter "make" to bash

To play enter "./Inferno" or "Inferno" deppending on your OS

TO DO:

instead of pauses in text output, ask the user to hit enter

make the items appear less often than they do now

track the user better in the landsacape? more like the cave game from the 80's

BUG: User can pick up duplicate items
