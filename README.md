# Simple Programs in C++: Dante's Inferno
### A short and simple text based game attempt at simulating a modern version of Dante's Inferno.

- To compile: Enter ```make```
- To play: Enter ```./Inferno``` or ```Inferno``` deppending on your OS

Final Project for OSU's Intro to Computer Science course, a text-based game where the player moves through a series of rooms or compartments. They will need to gather items to achieve some purpose. The purpose of this is to practice our use of pointers and linked structures while exercising our understanding of object oriented programming including inheritance and polymorphism.

TO DO:
- [ ] instead of pauses in text output, ask the user to hit enter
- [ ] make the items appear less often than they do now
- [ ] track the user better in the landsacape? more like the cave game from the 80's
- [ ] BUG: User can pick up duplicate items
